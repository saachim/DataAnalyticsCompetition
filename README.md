# DataAnalyticsCompetition
Through Dr. Kelly Slaughter's Business Analytics course in Fall 2016, I participated in a group data science competition sponsored by Capgemini. 

Each team was given a csv file with over 60,000 data sets representing snapshots in time of about 60 electric
submersible pumps (ESPs) used with oil wells subject to physical properties such as low pressure and high water cut. Through clustering, classification models, and predictive analytic models, each team was to analyze the data to gain insights into what factors made the ESPs fail. 

In this respository, you will find a .rmd file and a .ipnyb file. Our team used both R and Python to process, transform, classify, analyze, and visualize the data.

Our team was proud to place in the top three in this competition.
